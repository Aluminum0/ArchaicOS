  # ArchaicOS

Archaic OS is a linux based operating system that uses a brand new (in-progress) package manager.

(Archaic sounds much cooler than Arch)

A setup guide is in progress, and help would be appreciated!


**Crude setup guide:**
Prerequisites:
QEMU 
Debian 13 (in form of vm or otherwise)

First, make sure you have QEMU installed on a linux distribution such as Debian 13 (This is all I have tested on)
Next, type in git clone https://github.com/Aluminum0/ArchaicOS . This downloads this repo onto your device. 
After that, cd into the repo and locate QEMUARCHAIC.sh
Give it permissions by writing chmod +x QEMUARCHAIC.sh
Run ./QEMUARCHAIC .

Congrats!
